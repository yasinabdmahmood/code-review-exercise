    <h5 id="discription">
        12,837,420 views  Apr 5, 2019  The latest research is clear: the state of our attention determines the state of our lives. So how do we harness our attention to focus deeper, get distracted less, and even become more creative? Chris Bailey, author of the recent book Hyperfocus, talks about how our ability to focus is the key to productivity, creativity, and living a meaningful life.<br><br>

        Follow Chris on @chris_bailey Chris Bailey was recently described by TED as possibly “the most productive man you’d ever hope to meet”. He is the international bestselling author of Hyperfocus and The Productivity Project, which have been published in sixteen languages. Chris works with organisations around the globe on how they can become more productive without hating the process.<br><br>
        
        To date, Chris has written hundreds of articles on the subject of productivity, and has garnered coverage in media as diverse as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, New York magazine, The Huffington Post, Harvard Business Review, TED, Fortune, Fast Company, and Lifehacker. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx

            <h5 class="commentLine1">I have been off social media for 38 days and have came up with more life realizations and business/ life plans that I ever thought possible. I can also read for hours upon hours on end getting so dived up in what im reading that I forget the time. My mind simply has no reason to get distracted because there is nothing to distract my mind. This stuff works, where attention goes, energy flows! goodluck my friends</h5>
